## Tune Into Each Other's Energy

Beyond emotions, each person carries an energetic quality - the pace, intensity, and mood they bring to interactions. Learning to read and respond to your partner's energy creates more harmonious connection.

Sometimes supporting someone means matching their energy (getting excited with them or being calm alongside them). Other times it means offering balancing energy (bringing grounding when they're anxious, or gentle activation when they're low).

This awareness prevents mismatched interactions where one person brings high energy to someone who needs quiet, or tries to problem-solve when the other person needs emotional support.
