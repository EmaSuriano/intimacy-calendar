## Explore Their World

Intimate partners should be curious about each other's passions, work, and interests. Today you'll dive deep into something that matters to your partner but that you don't fully understand or appreciate yet.

The goal is genuine curiosity rather than polite interest. Ask follow-up questions, try to understand what draws them to this activity or subject, and see if you can participate in some small way.

This practice combats the tendency for couples to become focused only on shared interests, forgetting to stay curious about the parts of their partner's world that remain separate and unique.
