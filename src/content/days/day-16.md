## Practice Full Presence

In our distracted world, giving someone your complete, undivided attention is a rare gift. Today you'll practice being fully present with each other without the competing pull of phones, TV, or mental to-do lists.

The silence at the beginning helps you both transition from the busyness of the day into connection mode. Don't try to fill the quiet - let it create space for you to simply be together.

Eye contact during conversation deepens intimacy and ensures you're truly seeing each other. The agenda-free time afterward lets your connection settle without immediately rushing back to tasks or distractions.
