## Use Conflict as Connection

Conflict is inevitable in close relationships, but it doesn't have to create distance. Today you'll practice turning disagreements into opportunities for deeper understanding and connection.

The script gives you a framework for staying curious rather than defensive when tensions arise. Instead of trying to win the argument, you're trying to understand your partner's experience and find solutions that work for both of you.

This approach transforms conflict from something that threatens your relationship into something that actually strengthens it by increasing understanding and trust.
