## Start Daily Emotional Check-ins

Starting today, this becomes your daily practice. These three questions will anchor your relationship in emotional awareness and mutual support. They transform your daily talk time from a logistical update into a moment of genuine connection.

The key is to go beyond surface-level responses. Instead of "fine" or "good," encourage each other to name specific emotions: grateful, anxious, excited, overwhelmed, hopeful, frustrated. The more precisely you can name what you're feeling, the more your partner can understand and support you.

This daily ritual creates a safe container for sharing what's really going on inside. Over time, you'll notice patterns in each other's emotional rhythms and learn to offer support before it's even asked for.
