## Weekly Communication Review

This is your first checkpoint. After a week of intentional communication practices, it's time to assess what's working and recommit to your growth.

Reflection is crucial for lasting change. Without taking time to notice progress, it's easy to slip back into old patterns or assume that small improvements don't matter. Today you'll celebrate the positive changes and identify which practices deserve to continue.

The rating system helps you track progress over time. Don't worry if your number isn't high yet - the goal is improvement, not perfection. Even moving from a 4 to a 5 represents meaningful progress in how you connect with each other.
