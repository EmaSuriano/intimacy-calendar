## Increase Physical Touch

Physical intimacy isn't just about sexual connection - it's about the daily touches that create bonding and affection. Today you'll intentionally increase non-sexual physical contact throughout the day.

The 20-second hug is significant because it takes that long for your bodies to release bonding hormones like oxytocin. Quick hugs feel nice, but longer embraces create actual physiological connection.

Pay attention to how different types of touch affect your emotional connection. Notice which touches feel most natural and which ones you'd like to incorporate more regularly into your daily routine.
