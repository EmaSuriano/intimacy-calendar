## Appreciate Your Differences

Differences that initially attract us to someone can later become sources of conflict. The spontaneous person might later seem "irresponsible" to their planning-oriented partner. The thoughtful person might seem "indecisive" to their action-oriented partner.

Today you'll reframe one difference as a strength. Instead of seeing your differences as problems to solve, you'll recognize how they complement each other and make your relationship more complete.

When you appreciate rather than merely tolerate your differences, you create space for both people to be authentically themselves rather than trying to change to match their partner.
