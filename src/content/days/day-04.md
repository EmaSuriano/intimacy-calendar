## Practice Active Listening

True listening is rare. Most of the time when someone is speaking, we're planning what to say next, judging what they're sharing, or trying to solve their problems. Today you'll practice the art of simply receiving what your partner shares.

Active listening means your only job is to understand what your partner is experiencing. You're not trying to fix anything, agree or disagree, or relate it back to your own experience. You're creating space for them to feel fully heard.

When you reflect back what you heard, you're showing that you've truly received their message. This simple act of being witnessed and understood is one of the most intimate gifts you can give another person.
