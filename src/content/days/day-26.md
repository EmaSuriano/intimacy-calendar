## Experience Your Novel Activity

Today is about following through on the plan you made and being fully present for the new experience. Don't worry about whether you're "good" at the activity or whether it goes perfectly - the goal is shared adventure and memory-making.

Pay attention to how you experience new things as a team. Do you encourage each other? How do you handle challenges or awkward moments? Do you laugh together when things don't go as expected?

This shared experience becomes part of your relationship story - something you can reference and remember together. Even if the activity itself doesn't become a regular hobby, the memory of trying it together creates a bond.
