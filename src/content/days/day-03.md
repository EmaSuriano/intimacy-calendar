## Learn Communication Preferences

Every person has unique communication preferences shaped by their personality, family background, and past experiences. What feels supportive to one person might feel overwhelming or insufficient to another.

Today you'll discover the specific ways your partner receives and processes communication. Pay attention not just to their words, but to their tone and body language as they answer. Notice what lights them up versus what makes them tense.

This knowledge will transform your daily interactions. Instead of communicating the way you'd want to be communicated with, you'll learn to communicate in the way that actually reaches your partner most effectively.
