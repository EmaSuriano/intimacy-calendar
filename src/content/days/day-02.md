## Define What Intimacy Means

Intimacy means different things to different people. For some, it's deep emotional connection. For others, it's physical closeness, shared experiences, or feeling truly known and accepted. Today you'll discover what intimacy means to each of you.

The key is to share your definitions without judgment or immediate commentary. Let each person's words stand on their own first. Then look for the common threads - the places where your desires for intimacy overlap.

Your three shared goals will become the North Star for your relationship. When you're unsure about decisions or feel disconnected, you can return to these goals and ask: "Does this bring us closer to what we both want?"
