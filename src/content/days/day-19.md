## Create Sensory Connection

Shared sensory experiences create bonds that go deeper than words. When you notice and discuss what you're sensing together, you're literally sharing your perception of the world with each other.

The goal isn't to have the same responses - it's to learn how your partner experiences life through their senses. You might notice different textures, prefer different flavors, or hear different elements in the same song.

This practice brings you into the present moment together while revealing more about how each of you takes in and processes the world around you.
