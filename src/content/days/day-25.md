## Support Individual Growth

Healthy intimacy includes supporting each other's individual growth, not just your growth as a couple. The strongest relationships are made up of two people who are also thriving as individuals.

Be specific about the support you need. Do you need encouragement, accountability, space to pursue something on your own, or practical help? Different goals require different types of support.

Remember that supporting your partner's individual growth sometimes means giving them space to develop parts of themselves that don't directly benefit you or the relationship. This generosity strengthens trust and prevents codependency.
