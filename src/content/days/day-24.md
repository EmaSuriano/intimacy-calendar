## Create Something Together

Creating something together - whether it's a meal, art project, or rearranged living space - builds teamwork and gives you a tangible reminder of your collaboration. Today you'll work side by side to bring something new into existence.

Focus on the process more than the outcome. How do you navigate different ideas? How do you handle mistakes or setbacks? How do you celebrate small victories along the way? These teamwork skills strengthen your partnership in all areas.

The physical act of creating something together engages different parts of your brains than talking does, often leading to easy conversation and natural bonding as you work toward a shared goal.
