## Explore Childhood Influences

Understanding each other's childhood helps explain present-day patterns, triggers, and needs. The goal isn't to psychoanalyze or fix anything, but to develop empathy for why you each approach relationships the way you do.

Pay attention to both what your partner shares and how they share it. Notice what emotions come up as they talk about their past. This information will help you understand their sensitivities and respond with more compassion in future interactions.

Remember that you're not trying to heal each other's childhood wounds - you're simply creating understanding so you can love each other more effectively in the present.
