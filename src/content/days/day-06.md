## Address One Communication Block

Every relationship has patterns that create disconnection. Maybe one person interrupts frequently, or someone shuts down when things get intense, or feedback comes across as criticism even when it's meant to be helpful.

Today you'll identify one specific pattern that blocks your communication and make a concrete commitment to change it. The key is to choose something specific and actionable rather than vague personality changes.

Focus on behaviors you can control about yourself rather than what you want your partner to change. When both people take responsibility for their part in communication blocks, real transformation becomes possible.
