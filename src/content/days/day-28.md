## Integration and Commitment

After nearly a month of intentional intimacy building, it's time to distill your learning into sustainable practices. You can't maintain every single exercise, but you can commit to the ones that created the most connection and felt most natural.

Be honest about what actually worked versus what you think should have worked. Choose practices that both of you enjoyed and that fit realistically into your daily and weekly rhythms.

The monthly check-ins will help you maintain momentum and adjust your practices as your relationship evolves. Intimacy isn't a destination but an ongoing practice that needs regular attention and care.
