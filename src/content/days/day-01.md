## Establish Safe Communication Space

Today you'll create the foundation for all future intimate conversations. This isn't about solving problems yet - it's about creating the safe space where real connection can happen.

Start by putting away all distractions and sitting face-to-face. This physical positioning matters because it signals that you're both fully present and committed to this moment together.

The rules you establish today will become your relationship's communication charter. When future conversations get heated or difficult, you'll return to these agreements as your guide back to connection.
