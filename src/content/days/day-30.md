## Celebrate and Renew

Congratulations! You've completed 30 days of intentional intimacy building. Today is about celebrating how far you've come and setting your intention for continuing this growth.

The celebration should acknowledge the effort you've both put in and the positive changes you've experienced. Choose something that feels meaningful and fun for both of you.

Your relationship mission statement doesn't need to be complex - just a simple phrase or sentence that captures what you're committed to creating together. This becomes your North Star for making decisions and staying connected in the months and years ahead.

## Looking Forward

This calendar was just the beginning. The real intimacy comes from continuing these practices and staying committed to growth, curiosity, and connection with each other. You now have the tools - use them consistently and watch your relationship flourish.
