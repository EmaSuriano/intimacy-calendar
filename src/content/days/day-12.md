## Discuss Dreams and Goals

Intimate partners should be each other's biggest supporters and cheerleaders. But you can't effectively support dreams you don't know about or understand. Today you'll share your aspirations and learn how to better champion each other.

Listen for the emotion behind the goals - what drives these dreams? What would achieving them mean to your partner? Understanding the deeper meaning helps you offer more meaningful support.

The question about supporting each other's dreams is crucial. Sometimes people need encouragement, sometimes practical help, sometimes just someone who believes in them. Ask directly what kind of support would be most valuable.
