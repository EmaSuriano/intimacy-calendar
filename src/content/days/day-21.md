## Physical Connection Review

Three weeks in, you've experimented with various forms of physical intimacy. Now it's time to assess what's working and commit to the practices that create the most connection for both of you.

Physical intimacy preferences are highly individual. What feels loving to one person might feel overwhelming or insufficient to another. Today you'll identify your specific physical connection style as a couple.

Use this information to create a sustainable physical intimacy practice. Choose touches and activities that feel natural and connecting rather than forced or obligatory.
