## Plan a Novel Experience

Novelty creates bonding. When couples try new things together, they release dopamine and create shared memories that strengthen their connection. Today you'll plan an adventure - big or small - that you'll experience together for the first time.

The key is that it's new for both of you. This puts you on equal footing as beginners, creates natural conversation topics, and gives you a shared experience to reference in the future.

Don't overthink it - the "newness" is more important than the activity itself. Even trying a new coffee shop or taking a different route for your walk counts as a novel experience.
