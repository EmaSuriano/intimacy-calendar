## Emotional Connection Assessment

Two weeks in, it's time to assess your emotional intimacy progress. This isn't about being perfect - it's about noticing positive changes and identifying which practices are creating the most connection.

Pay attention to which exercises felt most natural versus which ones challenged you. Sometimes the practices that feel most uncomfortable are the ones creating the most growth, while other times they indicate a mismatch with your relationship style.

Use this assessment to customize your ongoing intimacy practices. Not every exercise will work for every couple, but the ones that do work should become regular parts of your relationship rhythm.
