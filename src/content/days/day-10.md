## Reveal Small Vulnerabilities

Vulnerability is the gateway to intimacy, but it doesn't have to start with your deepest secrets. Today you'll practice sharing something real but manageable - a small worry, minor insecurity, or something you usually keep to yourself.

The power is in the practice of being seen in your imperfection and receiving acceptance rather than judgment or advice. When your partner responds with understanding rather than trying to fix or minimize your feelings, it builds trust for future, deeper sharing.

Start small and let trust build gradually. The goal is to experience that sharing your authentic self leads to connection, not rejection or criticism.
