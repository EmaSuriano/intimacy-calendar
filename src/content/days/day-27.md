## Dream About Your Future

Healthy relationships need a forward-looking vision that excites both partners. Today you'll dream together about your shared future and make concrete plans that give you both something to anticipate.

Start with near-term, achievable plans and expand to bigger dreams. Having a mix of short-term and long-term shared goals creates ongoing excitement and gives your relationship direction and purpose.

This isn't about creating pressure or rigid expectations, but about aligning your dreams and making sure you're both excited about where your relationship is heading.
