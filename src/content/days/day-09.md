## Share Current Emotions

Most of us learned to give surface-level answers to "How are you?" But intimacy requires going deeper. Today you'll practice naming and sharing your actual emotional state, not just your social response.

Specific emotion words help your partner understand your inner world more clearly. "Overwhelmed" gives different information than "stressed," and "hopeful" conveys something different than "good." The more precisely you can identify what you're feeling, the more your partner can empathize and support you.

The goal isn't to fix each other's emotions, but to create space where all feelings are welcome and witnessed. This acceptance builds the safety needed for even deeper sharing in the future.
